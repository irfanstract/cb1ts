If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

   1. [if The Above Benefited Solution cannot _fully_ operate without the Work or the Compiled form thereof, then](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3)
      [the Solution-or-Service, _by definition_, is considered Statically-Linked to the Work, and therefore](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3)
      [you must](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3)
      [publicly make the Source form, and possibly the Object form too, of that (exact) version of the Work,](https://opensource.org/license/agpl-v3).

   any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
   _It is your responsibiliy_
   _to_ ensure that the contents of the NOTICE file do not provide views conflicting with any (pre)existing facts, including, but not limited to, this COPYING or LICENSE file, and the README file too.

For this purpose,
[if parts of your own "private code" cannot operate without the Work (hence called "Statically-Linked 3rd-Party Code" as defined in "Definitions" above), the affected "private code" is, _by definition_, part of the Work](https://opensource.org/license/lgpl-3-0).
see "Definitions" above.

any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor
